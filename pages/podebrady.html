                  Podebrady is a historic spa town located in the Central
                  Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic, situated on the banks
                  of the Elbe River (Labe). It lies approximately 60 kilometers
                  east of Prague.

                  South of the town is located Poděbrady Lake. It is a 260 ha
                  (640-acre) large lake, created by the flooding of an excavated
                  sandstone quarry. It is mainly used for recreational purposes.

                  An ancient community and a small fortress originated near the
                  ford. It is most likely that the position of this community is
                  reflected in the present name of the town: pode brody = "below
                  the ford".

                <h4 class="font-weight-550">In history</h4>
                <p class="margin-bottom-0">
                  The first written mention of Poděbrady is from 1223, the first
                  unverified mention is from 1199.[4] A long-distance trade
                  route running from Prague to eastern Bohemia and then on to
                  Silesia and Poland passed through the then-forested landscape
                  interwoven with a dense network of river branches. This
                  important communication intersected the Elbe River to the west
                  of the present town, at a place called Na Vinici. The
                  Poděbrady estate was private, but between 1262 and 1268, it
                  became the property of King Ottokar II as escheat, and he
                  built a stone water castle in Poděbrady. The place has become
                  a popular destination for rulers due to its proximityto Prague
                  and the possibility of hunting in local forests.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  A historic milestone of the history of the town was the year
                  1905, when it was visited by the German estate owner Prince
                  von Bülow. This well-known water diviner marked the place of a
                  strong spring in the castle's inner courtyard, which was later
                  bored to a depth of 97.6 metres (320 ft). The discovery of
                  carbonic mineral water resulted in the opening of the first
                  spa in 1908. After World War I Poděbrady rapidly changed into
                  a spa town which from 1926 specialized in the treatment of
                  cardiovascular diseases, rapidly gaining renown not only in
                  the Czech Republic, but also abroad.

                  Maria Theresa. Today it serves as a museum and monument of

                  The square is made up of terraced houses of Renaissance and
                  Baroque origin and former Renaissance town hall from the 16th
                  century, nowadays a library. The Neo-Renaissance building of
                  the Civic Bank from 1898 is also valuable. The Baroque Marian
                  column dates from 1765. A significant element of the square is
                  the Monument of King George with his equestrian statue,
                  created in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1890–1896 according to
                  the design by Bohuslav Schnirch. Since 2024, it has been
                  protected as a national cultural monument.

                  created on the site of a former manor park according to the
                  project of architect František Janda. Gradually, more parts
                  were added and the park expanded. The glass colonnade of
                  Professor Libenský was built in 1938. The colonnade was built
                  above a spring of mineral water.

                  designed by Antonín Engel in 1913, built in 1914–1919. It is
                  valued for still functional technology and its architectural
                  solution. It is one of the oldest locks in the Middle Elbe and
                  at the same time a valuable example of technological and
                  operational solutions for this type of waterworks.[15] The
                  power plant is protected as a national cultural monument.
